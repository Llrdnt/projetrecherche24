It is senseless for animal to live for millions of years evolving just for their species to die off to kidness and virtuality. Reform, rejoice, recreate.

original >>3
Look at the usernames. Dig on those accounts. Make a throwaway ig if you have to. some tools below i have found useful in making ig accounts.
https://smsreceivefree.com/
https://sms24.me/numbers
unlimited aliases to a single gmail account (dot trick) --> https://generator.email/blog/gmail-generator
Apparently you Gotta be logged in on the instagram.com site to dig. Not sure if 3rd party web viewers like tofo.me still work.

Last thread >>3 I will keep up because the images that are broken are named the archive.is generated random letter url of the archive.is archive of the images.

Instagram no longer can be archived. I will try and explain the photos this time to encourage more people to dig. Look at the usernames and click on the people who comment their photos and so on and screencap all the cult activity.

For example pic related @blackbodegabag is a good example and even a starting point.

Probably nothing but I ran into an odd instagram account @bootleg_daycare. it appears to be daycares with bootleg cartoon characters on it but maybe there is something else to this. In the 90's the main focus of the satanic panic was that they took place at sordid daycares. Some of these are just in black town or in mexican areas so that is why it looks ghetto and crummy. But some of them are these cartoon characters holding pizza so i thought i would add it to the thread.

Prime suspect "Sizzle Pie" shutting down its "Capitol Hill" location in Seattle. There was a post about this place previously as being suspicious but the thread is gone.

This place was next to a day-care facility, an art gallery and had a Satanic themed bar under the same roof ... within a month of Epstein dying, it's shutting down.

The elites are cleaning house.
