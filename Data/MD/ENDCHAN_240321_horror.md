I need your help /horror/ Anonymous 02/22/2024 (Thu) 22:38 [Preview] No. 4761 [Reply] [X] [Last 50 Posts]
I asked the creator of where my waifu is from if she was a virgin, and he said no, and I have been absolutely seething over fucking over the past fucking years.

I can't really let go; I just want him to change his mind over this, and the only way I think is by using supernatural help like goetia demons or what.

Which would be the most suitable one to solve this little problem of mine?

Maybe Stolas or Vine ?

The other thing is, how does one not be afraid of the supernatural when summoning the Goetia demon for the first time? I never had a supernatural or paranormal experience in my life before.

Here we discuss theories, new information, and experiences regarding the covert efforts to affect our world.

If you have something not on the iceberg, please give a QRD and some kind of evidence.

Questions on the iceberg welcome, but understand that many of them are jokes, so use common sense.

If you haven't already, get a VPN, a tinfoil hat, a blanket, some ambient music, and get ready for some maximum comfy, frens.

Points of interest:
6:02-6:37
11:39-12:02
14:48-21:05 (note the 'temples without windows' concept as in underground, scarcely lit mithraeums, just like in freemasonry where there should be no light other than the invisible, spiritual light of the Black Sun which gives illumination - Sun gods in their esoteric cults actually refer to that 'sun', Saturn, not the visible daylight giving Sun)

TL;DW - Constantine was a die hard pagan and never truly converted. He mixed Mithraism with Christianity into what became Catholicism, an administrative structure serving Rome instead of God. Persecutions in a way stopped and, naively, many early Christians bought into Rome's deception, exchanging simple truth of the Gospel for arcane rituals, status, safety and worldly riches, in turn becoming persecutors themselves.

I'm a developer. I know about the actual metaverse.
Is there some way I should use this circumstance?
Is there a chat room where this would be appropriate to discuss?

few years back, dont remember if it was 2020 or 2021, there was a thread here or on another chan about a man who was wanted by the police for "kidnapping" his daughter. After this news came out there was a video of his supposed daughter who claimed she was "alright and nothing is wrong." lot of anons were speculating the videos of her were AI generated and she probably didnt exist in the first place. I remember there being screenshots of it being posted on 4chan but they would get taken down everytime, cant really find any info on this anymore and wasnt really in the habit of saving things at the time, anyone remember anything like this?

Im rick. From new england. Died in a coma, breaks into meditation and an inquisitive mind have me dreaming of Greatness.I pivoted around empath, My compassion this time around is Zen. A lot of it was in there already. Nothing, and everything. I learned everything. So naturally i want to be the best man i can be? LOOL, i faced resistance here. Racism used to excuse indolence is sickening.

I wrote profound poetry. The page froze. If i didnt double check my clipboard purge wouldntve been noticed the Heskahazing. They shoulkd have checked how much i like naked history rabbitholes. Im pushed away from this. Like when i ask in my "punk" ways why women are a protected elite. Ill be terse. How does New England's Neptune Lobster boy Come home to sunny sands and a place to contemplate Greatness.

Words have power. Magnets, the myth of Myths. I found your pieces getting real good at turning on tuning in dropping out...through discipline. Everyone misses that. I read. I didn't turn into a gremlin when well dressed Saudis came into my floridian drinking hole. Chatted, instant connection. Asked the elephant in the room if it could spill the obvious. A silly chuckle, i smell truth. Allah's light doesnt shine here. He cant see me. I used to think well thats just an excuse at first. My subsconsious saw its training wheels.

Seekers of greatness, I read your prophecies. Yall looking for my butt arent ya? Last night i taught the art of nothing to an Adam adherent. My god if it didnt digest like it never left.

Profound Spontaneity with the jade ego cutting of humor, Masculine virtue embracing Asceticism, Everyone makes mistakes, rise above J-man. Lets make Heka Super Friends.


TLDR: New england kid with a heart of gold, too smart for his own good and a bit of Rapscallity, burning out on western esoterism Due to the lack of any Masculinity, in search of truth of my Empathic abilities and pure peace to do it in. Tried to research on the best of whims how to feasibly go study Persian Astronomy in Tehran. VPN wall. Good, keep sosdoms sewers outta your drinking line. But there the truth set in. They push to keep us apart. Brothers of the Dao, of the Atom, of the man of the Adam all. Inshallah? I say it in hesitation with an olive branch, and because....I think its time. You dont hope for the movie to start when its started. I read. I hermitized. I compared sans attatchment. Yep. They got the Curry and Anime tiddies. But they didnt get the Courage to cut the cord.

Some ways to handle affects of Gangstalking? Anonymous 10/06/2019 (Sun) 03:39 [Preview] No. 3565 [Reply] [X] [Last 50 Posts]
Gang stalking is simply a form of community mobbing and organised stalking combined. Just like you have workplace mobbing, and online mobbing, which are both fully recognised as legitimate, this is the community form.

Gang stalking is organised harassment at it's best. It the targeting of an individual for revenge, jealousy, sport, or to keep them quite, etc.

It's organised, widespread, and growing. Some describe this form of harassment as, "A psychological attack that can completely destroy a persons life, while leaving little or no evidence to incriminate the perpetrators."

How so? I may have been shot at the other night. nothing serious just a pop in the parking lot as i was doing my thing. i also (with the help of many others!!!) thwarted partially a plot to burn a large tree covered in vines that had died in order for my comped father to bang on my door with a sledgehammer (that i have now in my bedroom :)) and basically bludgeon me to death in my sleep.this shit was huge lil nas x is lil x-mas. nas instead of mas mn seriously. whole conjunction ritual they had reversed by shamanas. the masons decided to pressure my family to "get rid of me". knocked unconcious by my own father. dragged out an unlocked window by my neighbor and some old guy who thinks i have to be stabbed with screwdrivers for not being a boomer. i barricaded the door with multiple layers of wood ladders etc. i twisted the flammable vines off of the tree. i called out and closed my bedroom window after it was opened. i made a stink about the pickup truck with the hard top covering they wanted to put my unconscious body into. i wore a motorcycle helmet to protect my head from the swinging hammers and baseball bats that where surely going to come my way. i loudly declared america to be superior to masonic dogma. they can't really do jack shit now and you have to without being a hypest. control the situation. these people mirror you and whatnot. say "hey give me some space". being a gangstalking faggot they have to do so no matter what.

I pissed off the security there and they've been harassing me ever since. I completely mine my own business and they will sometimes swarm me in a show of force but act like they're just talking about something work related that happens to be near me. They provoke me off camera, spy on me around corners etc. I've gone to HR and they completely ignored me until I got the director involved. Do in thinking they spoke to HR and said something about me.

gangstalking happens but its effect can be applied in reverse if you don't let the psyop get to you.

requires some nerves as steel mixed with a "I don't even care" atittude.

Doesn't fully end it but mitigates it. Plus the gangstalkers end up feeling demoralized and impotent at some point, and now the psychological cost to gangstalk you has increased.

Many stalked are also getting poisoned and dont know about it. Stalkers often involve family if you are a "starseed" Our controllers decide when we reincarnate and keep us as ignorant as possible. "Starseeds" "neurodivergent" "indigo children" etc are all different ways to say free thinker/open minded. They are born into masonic, satanic, religious groups and cults. Our controllers dont want us to know

Hello endchan, lets think about why the world is just utterly shit and unfair. In my statement, I will explain the one topic that hasnt been discussed into all of this. This is a text file. I don't favor posting on /horror/ since my statement is true and not fiction.

So I read most of the MEGA file, and I'm not convinced something like this could happen on the scale you describe without many more people publicly talking about it.
First off, how did you come by all this information about these gangstalker's motives and innerworkings? Do you have any evidence that these people are actually part of such a group?
>inb4 they are indistinguishable from normal people/no evidence can be given
Well then it's just as likely that everything you said is false. If what you say is true, I wouldn't see any reason to stay alive, so the only alternative is to assume the optimistic view.
Second, if they were real, you wouldn't be able to post this without either getting Epteined or having your gangstalking ramped up as punishment. Which makes you either oblivious, meaning your advice would be useless, or you don't really believe what you're saying.

people where talking about zeronet. The only thing I saw as suspicious was that it loads pages equally as fast while running zeronet through proxies/tor and running it normally ./
It may just be the way the content loads but aside from that and the javascript it seems like a nice modern looking sort of torrent-web.
I have been interested in IPFS the interplanetary file system. It is distributed and seems to be pretty ideal for archival of webpages pic related is what got me interested.

Judaism was a Dionysus cult that got tied into a Judean identarian movement in Canaan.
The Judeans were originally a subset of Canaanite people, and Hebrew was just a dialect of Canaanite mutually intelligible with the other dialects. They decided to start a regionalist movement because they wanted independence from the other Canaanite tribal leaders. The cult of Dionysus was already somewhat popular in Judea (as it was throughout Greece and other areas of the Mediterranean), so the leaders of Judea decided to make the Dionysian religion a distinctive feature of Judean identity, setting them apart from their Canaanite siblings who still practiced generic Semitic polytheism.
The cult of Dionysus originated in Mesopotamia, near the Zagros Mountains, circa 6000 BC. It spread west alongside winemaking technology. Wherever viticulture appeared, so too did the Dionysian cult. The cultists generally memorized the texts rather than writing them down, because they did not want the common folk to learn of the mysteries (this is why we have very little written material from the Greek mystery cults, for example).
The Judeans were the exception to this rule. They wrote down the ancient Dionysian texts because they wanted to carve their identity "in stone" so to speak. They translated the texts into Hebrew, and translated "Dionysus" as "Yahweh", a minor Canaanite god who ruled over the region of Judea.
Judeans didn't actually come from Mesopatamia, they were of Levantine descent just like all Canaanites. They wewuzzed as Mesopotamians because the Dionysian texts they translated into Hebrew follow the history of the Dionysian cult as it spread out of Mesopotamia, and they wanted to identify themselves with the progenitors of the Dionysus cult.

In my studies of lucid dreaming and the like, I may have stumbled upon the real-life Backrooms.

>inb4 LARP

It only seems to work with Theta waves, and even then only on the brink of sleep. I wanted to try a cosmic, out-of-body thing, and that's how it first started.
While I was thinking about how I am not myself (in the dumb hippy way, spiritually, cosmic being), I began to fade into a kind of luke-bright light.

Pics related were the closest I could find, although it was more of a mix of the two, bright light at the end, pinkish-purple, and no gravity. Felt like I was falling forward forever.

Strangest part was that I randomly woke up, no reason, the theta waves and everything was the same. I think I might try it again.

Also for full disclosure, I drink, but I have never tried psychedelics or other drugs.

For now I'm calling it the "Luminal Road" until I can do it again and learn more.

I'm not fully sure what you mean by stuff from hyperspace leaking into lucid consciousness but according to this https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&t=62070 it eventually stays with you in some ways.

Imagine being a sheltered farm boy and venturing forth to the dangerous parts of the city after dark (but that might be a poor analogy as not every thug is connected to a crime underworld hivemind).

Listen to that guy's story https://youtube.com/watch?v=os32tIzAm14 [Embed]
He's still in it, he's not against it so you can't say his account is biased negatively by a paradigm (like 'spirits bad demons bad don't do witchcraft kiddos'). The thing is he doesn't realize he's being duped but if you listen carefully in some later part (that's 1/4) the behaviour of the spirit he interacts with changes drastically. It takes away the affection and begins to provide it conditionally, in a calculated manner, wanting more humans to interact with it. People in the comments noticed the red flags, some even say that this thing is demonic because it acted so deviously. The 'shaman' himself remains duped but that means you can trust more in some things he's saying because he's not trying to make it sound bad to warn you.

Dissecting the experiences of others around you for life lessons is a very helpful ability as it can help you evade threats before they harm you. Both good and bad present itself as good. It always starts nice. I know I probably sound like fear mongering, jealous, puny man who doesn't get to have fun and prohibits others from having it but going out into shadier parts of town really isn't safe and I'd have a blood on my hands if I didn't warn you when I get the option to.

O9A are decentralized and have no overall central governing structure. This makes it really easy for glowies to infiltrate.

By all means, read NAOS. Once you strip some of the larp away, there is some very good practical advice in there.

Brute-forcing Blocked SRA memories Anonymous 06/16/2020 (Tue) 09:50 [Preview] No. 3948 [Reply] [X] [Last 50 Posts] >>4702
unrepressing and/or associating dissasosiative sra memory's by any means necessary within reason
This is aside from very triggering possibly it should be. Also another reason this is not endeavored is because if you try and think of sra if you are not at least aware of memory fragments or are still riding the unicycle of traumatic mind control. You may intentionally imagine things pieced and derivative of a fake imaginative thing in order to deflect from black fear endueced precognition repression/disassociation. I have memories that do not make sense from childhood. I have memory fragments that are gratuites to irl local digging of sra that even lines up with events now brought to light due to covid making people bicker and bring up shit from the 1990's to their spouse. The location is consistant with a google maps anomily that has since been corrected showing a masonic lodge in my county under the water by a bridge. I realized that bridge is the location of the memory fragment A the clown masked man in the back of the car/van going up dark to light and on the bridge 30 miles away from my town which has a simular bridge so i assumed the bridge was the local one. A pizza parlor is directly by the bridge that has stone brickwork a gratiut to memory fragment 2A the red brick archway and possibly torch or low lighting. Feel it had to do with a secret wall or hidden underwater dungeon access. Breif dungeon memory fragment C. Not much but smallish dungeon room and hellish things i can't think of because of the black fear.
So i am at the point i need to shake something loose. Now i have devised a personal shamanic system of vetting such speculous remebering or trying to recall what sra was. I just wrote it out a couple of times. Only say what you know for a fact (to yourself or here i dont care lets shake this shit loose). If you have memories as a young child that make no sense or any low ceiling churchy memories of churches you never went to yet see in your town and somehow know what the inside looks like. Things like that.
also this is not something you want to have had happened to you. Don't try and think the pumpkin patch you went to in an early memory was sordid to feel cultured. Do it only if it was a memory you can remember yourself recalling earlier in your life. I call that mesurection.Because your whole life is shown to be a hiding of this. Very troubling. And fuck it make one up we (self sra memory crackers)should be able to know if its real or not based on whats real. This is going to be very improvisational and may be too personal as in only i can relate to memories i had. But themes and patterns may emerge if others have had similar experiences.
pic related. I had already came to the conclusion i was editing out my memories hence fragments. Very good overview of this kind of thing.

sra isn't rare. having been in therapy for it for a number of years now, there is a very active satanic church operating in the upper middle class, at the least. i can say that at all the four schools i went to there were always at least a few others who i can name with near certainty.

This thread is for plausible or otherwise definitely legit /x/ related things. Diy ufos, solid proof of ghosts. Maybe even the creation of your own spooky stuff. No idea why you dont have its own mtf teams hunting skinwalkers but ok. Most of my stuff cant be accessed cause of my harddrive and laptop being damaged.

Well, I would call this man a cryptid, but he is already confirmed by multiple civilian and government sources in Switzerland to exist. Pic related is Le Loyon, a man over six feet tall who roams the forest, simply observing people and acting similarly to Bigfoot sightings. He has never hurt anyone, and simply appears to want to be left alone. The police have attempted to speak with him (and have sighted him), but were unsuccessful..
The main question is why this man is in the woods wearing military equipment of the highest quality you can get in Euro countries. Does he fear something, does he know something?

This is pretty much a blatant, blogpost, but I a.) am unwilling to squander effort on /b/ and b.) one more thread won't hurt this board in the slightest.

Disclaimer aside, I work as a Head Orderly in an inner-city hospital in Detroit, Michigan. I will attempt to tell all stories to the fullest and truest detail, while omitting identifiable information where applicable.

Many of you may know the facts, realities, and situations herein all to well, but remember that not all have the same information. With that said, all contributions are welcome.

I suppose it is best to start by explaining the general layout of the facility and the different places within it both to save time in future and to add to understanding.

The hospital is organized into three main sections, each added over time as the needs of the city increased and as corporate acquired more wealth. The first is the original component (East, West, and East II). This is still the primary residence portion for the poor, Negro, and more needy patients. The next is the North Tower, the newest addition that is primarily used as a separate space for the rich and favored, as well as outpatient services. The last is the Critical Care Building, which houses the Emergency Department (ED), the Intensive Care Units (ICUs), the OR, and most children's services.

There are other structures, locations, and sections of the hospital, but I will cover those as they appear and as they become relevant to the exploitation of the masses.

At last we come to a portion of this introduction with some substance, a brief description of the units and the shit that goes down there.

The 'Floors'

>1 North

Incorrectly named, this is simply the ground floor of the tower, and hosts most imaging services and test sites, as well as Nuclear Medicine. Despite (or in fact in light of) the fact that no patients stay here, it is one of the best places for them to be at any given time.

>1W

The Clinical Decision Unit (CDU) is a grey area, technically being part of the ED but located in the main hospital. It mainly serves as a way to placate lying niggers into staying one or two nights, then pissing off once the hospital can prove they're fine.

(Note: Nigger does not refer to a black necessarily, rather an ill behaved one (white or black). I will refer to civil blacks as Negros or by nothing at all.)

>1 East

A newly renovated and converted floor, it serves as the primary stroke unit (although de jure general neurology). It also has the concerning addition of built in monitoring cameras in every room, staring at you from the ceiling (yes, more on that later).

I've been subject to mind reading technology/abilities by aliens, one time when I was laying in bed letting my mind flow freely as it usually does, I suddenly started thinking of aliens and the most unbelievable thing happened to me, I was laying on my chest and my pelvis moved itself up by the means of telekinesis and I could feel my buttocks being fondled, and I could also feel my penis as it was taking place.
I hate talking about this because it is ridiculous to think about that not only would something like this happen to a person but the idea that the intetion behind it was sexual adds another layer of ridiculousness to the entire story and makes it even less believable. Shortly before the incident happened and I was thinking about how aliens wouldn't like me or something of that nature, I could feel something akin to a layer of non-tangible energy around my thoughts, I could quite literally feel my thoughts being monitored as I was thinking them. This incident, as unbelievable as it may seem, is completely true and has changed my perspective of life forever.

It isn't the only paranormal thing that has happened to me, but it is by far the most reliable piece of experience I have experienced in my life that proves the existence of the paranormal.
Anything else that has happened to me, could entirely have been a product of my own imagination, but this incident has had reality shattering repercussions in my life and no matter how much I tell myself that I might not be very sane there's no possible way in the world that I could subject my own self to telekinesis.
But there's questions that comes with the incident, who did it, why did they do it, how do they do it, and how do they look? These are answers I will likely never in my life get and I am destined to sit here pondering about it for the rest of my life without getting reliable answers to what might have happened that night. The paranormal exists, and I don't know for sure, but taking into consideration the fact that I was thinking thoughts related to aliens, and that the incident happened shortly after thinking about aliens, then based off of that alone I can only assume that aliens were involved in what happened.
I could be wrong since I don't know much about this, it could have been human technology that is just very confidential, I am not closing any doors for possibilities, but no matter what happens to me in the future I will always think back of that night and let my imagination play a part in rationalizing it. If you are one of those people who never have experienced anything paranormal and completely shut down any possibilities of paranormal events actually having existed in real life, then I am sorry to break it to you, but you are wrong.
Life for me after that night made me realize that anything in this world is entirely possible and I feel good that there are no limitations to the possibility of things that could potentially take place in our lifetimes. I, before that incident, had a connection with skeptics who refused to believe anything paranormal happened and just played around with the idea of things of paranormal nature existing for fun, but deep down I was a skeptic myself.
But now the circumstances of things that happened has made me completely lose any form of connection with the rational skepticism that takes place very often in the subject of the paranormal. I am not here to try and convince you of anything, and I surely cannot prove that it happened beyond my own words detailing the experience, but I do want to maybe tell you that life isn't as mundane as you might otherwise think and that there are definitely unexplained things that take place in the world that for the majority of people could only be considered to be fantasy.
I hate the idea that I could consider myself special because of what happened, I like to think that there are many others out there like me who have experienced things similar and just were unable to convince those next to them that it is the truth and have given up on trying to convince them of it, much like myself.

Fireworks Psyop Anonymous 06/24/2020 (Wed) 02:39:15 [Preview] No. 3997 [Reply] [X] [Last 50 Posts]
In several American cities, people have been putting up with the incessant noise of fireworks from sundown until sunup. It's caused enough of a stir that publications have jumped to try and explain this phenomenon as "kids bored because of corona." Most of these articles are careful not to correlate it with the BLM riots or the defunding of police around the country, but if you look at the comments in articles that allow them, people are blaming the defunding of police directly.

I've seen comments under some of these articles, as well as on twitter, that people have witnessed these fireworks being brought into cities in bulk and handed out to kids.

If you google "why am I hearing fireworks every night" you'll see how widespread this is. Is this the next phase in a greater plan to destabilize and cause general woe around the country?

In the city, I've seen the remnants of what they've fired off the previous night. Definitely commercial fireworks. The pre-packed cakes you light once. It's obvious people are lighting them in the street and then leaving without even watching it. They're just running around and shooting them in random places.

Okay, so after looking through a bunch of stuff and being a soundfag, had to check up on some things.

Turns out, the LRAD stuff is being used and abused. The large bangs were being set off for funsies in certain areas, which doesn't always include fireworks. A majority of these sounds were tests/ accidents that were completely uncalled for, spanning the entire continent ALONGSIDE the fucking fireworks. It's not just a PSY OPs, it's also an irritant; something to get people to call the cops instead of looking into it themselves.

Starting looking into stuff like Aztec Death Whistles, Operation Wandering Souls, unexplained sounds, LRADs, etc. and found out that this is just them getting people to not riot by using these.

Honestly it would be easier to go out and spread the virus than it would be to get involved in riots/ etc. obligatory fuck that shit

You like Dead by Daylight? Their early work was belittle noob saves as a waist. But when Portrait of a Murder came out November 2021, I think they really gamed into their zone, eternally and realistically. Scourge Hook: Pain Resonance causes clear, crisp screams of survivors causing them to be downed, and delightful fleeing compensates dealing with intersectional feminism that really causes Dead by Daylight to seduce. Victims aren't always scared let me dispel this fellows, but I think the survivors have far more Twitter morals like a tumor. In October 2017, Devs released this: Nightmare!, the most demolished victims. I think their best polluted killer is "Nemesis". A murderer so catchy, most survivors probably don't position away when he rips. But they should, because it's not just about pressuring minorities and the performance of friends. It's also reversing for blatant finesse see for yourself. No gun, no mall! Put on a mask and save Anglos like you have foresight, you fuckin stupid bastards!

Why is it that so many people willingly sign off their lives to the Elite? Do they realize they are going to be thrown to the wolves eventually and not care, or are they just that stupid?
I once saw a report that stated only one-third of people even have internal monologues. Are people brainwashed, or are some just more genetically 'normie' than others?
Honestly I just want to know how we can live by working around them, I've completely lost hope on trying to help them. Thoughts?

>Why blacks join masonic lodges even though they are locked on being second class members.
This is very much a USA thing with Freemasonry, though it may happen elsewhere too.
The Blacks in the US have Prince Hall Freemasonry. Prince Hall formed a lodge for slave soldiers during the civil war after allegedly walking into a British camp and asking to become a member, where he was initiated on the promise of no longer fighting in the war.
If the origin story proved true, I'd imagine it was purely a D&C move by the British officers at the time.
Prince Hall lodges hold a charter from UGLE.

This is only a brief guide about what I gathered. To deeper knowledge of why I am saying this all, you'll'ave to research on your own. This practices are designed to outcast most defficiencies known by wizkids away (muh brainfog, restlessness, etc), exceptuating only those given by genome:

>leave all diaries, inmediately
>leave grains: no wheat, corn or rice at all
>eat your foods within a reduced schedule, rather than through all the day long
>avoid starchy foods and red meats
>if not vegetarian, eat meats briefly: like once a week or two weeks
>the softest and wealthiest meats are white fish
>do you like nuts? They are still acidifiers...
>learn your ayurveda body type (dosha) and how to regulate it

If you want quick results, these are the shock therapies:
>fasting regularly (the body must slowly develop its ability to detox or adversities a.k.a "detox crisis" are to be faced. The same on mucusless diet.)
>colon enema
>HIIT exercise
>do not use domestic cooling/heating unless your body strictly requires so, due to some sickness or whatever else
>drink hot water, as much as it can be without harming your mouth

IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE A FAKE USA CARD THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN POSTED ARE FEDPOSTS / BAD FAKES, I FIXED BASICALLY EVERYTHING I COULD, HERE IS A REFERENCE IMAGE OF THE DISTRIBUTED FAKE AND THE ONE I MADE

I edited a 1:1 card with a reference to the original, further directions on how to fill out the card are not included, you can find them in the corona generals on pol.

not saying anyone not to fake the card - enough people will do it anyway to warrant the next step anyway
just a heads up that faking of covid cards will be used as a justification for RFID sort of smart mark baalshit digital vaccine certificate that will either be the thing that entitles you to banking system/shopping or it will have bank account tied to it in a post global reset cashless society and having such certificate will be the only way to buy/sell
so having a paper certificate won't buy you much time
it might be too late to prepare it but have some innawoods/rural retreat ready and accessible or if that's not an option then repent and get beheaded for Jesus when Christians start getting taken away to friendly, inclusive reindoctrination/quarantine centers (not concentration camps at all nuh-uh) that will start forcefully reincarnating people that refuse to go along with NWO

The greatest reason for the German Reich's failure in WW2 was the occult garbage and Nordic LARPing of Himmler and the upper-portion of the SS.

Like it or not, National Socialism was Christian from its outset.

>inb4 source

Mein Kampf and endless speeches, as well as records of churches in the Reich support the fact that Christianity was promoted.

Had Hitler stuck to his guns, rather than letting Himmler waste time with Atlantis and meth, the war would have ended differently. Worse yet, the actions of the more sadist and esoteric officers allowed the (((modern world))) to levy criticisms on the NSDAP that are exaggerated or simply limited to lunatics in the ranks, who everyone else hated.

Now the question, what caused Himmler to fall for the pagan meme?

Each time one of their false gods constructed through fictional bullshit fails it makes them positively sick.

These literal socio-political deceptions so many people can't afford to survive without.

And every time they are disproven as nonsense the people get more positively sick. The masses that need to be possessed in order for their systems to function that revolt and balk anytime one of their precious deceptions are threatened.

And as increasingly important alters fail, the astounded masses will be positively sickened at the prospect because their minds were created by and perpetuating a false reality. And as each pillar of false alters is demolished their strength of the foundations of their false reality weakens, as the more important false gods they achieved fail. In the astonishment of such vast fictional pillars of false reality failing, they become more positively sick.

And all the deception, make believe and folly research and development will only get the sickness to sleep deeper into the depths of their corrupt cultures and bodies.

I see it over and over again in places that touch on conspiratorial topics: people who talk like they're prophets or sages or whatnot and end up reaching no one.
Not everything can be said in simple terms, yes, but consider this, even if you hold the pearl of highest knowledge what's the point of speaking about it if you do in a way that isn't understandable?

I had to read it several times and I'm still not sure what the 'sick' is - is it 'angry; disgusted' or 'ill; diseased' in the context of OP.

Late reply but whatever, someone might read it and get the wrong idea too. It's not even about the Scots (from Scotia, egyptian princess, also consider Scottish Rite of Freemasonry) or the Irish (Tuatha de Danan, tribe of Dan?) as much as it is about the lineage that's characterized by red and blonde hair. Not every redhead is a part of this but when you read that Mohammad had red hair as did Barbarossa (literrally Redbeard) gears should start turning in your head. If I remember correctly king David was described as a ginger too but I'm not sure how to process that information. Anyway, as it turns out, in most myths or accounts that tell about giants they have blonde or red hair (and are often said to come from somewhere underground, Hitler was very interested in that underground - Agartha). An easy example would be those Eastern Island heads were unearthed and actually are full sculptures of giants with what looks like red hats but was intended to be the hair.

What are the possible governmental solutions to the infestation of the occult in nearly every State on Earth?
I am not suggesting that we can defeat a demonic enemy in our own power, or that we will even get the chance to do so, but in an ideal scenario, how would we do it?
I've seen people on this board critiquing Monarchy as having occult alliances/roots, but I am presently unaware of them.
>Please enlighten me if you know.
Alternatively, I can't see Republics as they stand faring much better; the Anti-Monarchist Party in the early United States was crushed by both sides early on and the people have been oppressed more and more ever since.
It's obvious that Man's government will always be imperfect, but does anyone have any clue on how we could improve, even if only in theory.
>Example
My understanding and experience lead me to view the HRE as the high point of human civilization and interaction: Federal, de-centralized, Christian, (somewhat) elective, and with Free Cities to boot.

Trump tried to buck the system and they implemented a third party pandemic to exert control. with the mail in ballots. because of this that is an example of how the deception supersedes politics. making an election stipulation based on a narrative on a planned pandemic response. They also localized and had mailmen flinging ballots into trashcans and things of that nature. of course the media and censorship helped. The president can not go on twitter. facebook blocked. Why? No one seems to notice. They completely silenced his voice in the public conversation.

And when they finally reach the end of the beastly eternal game of greed, extortion and sabotage - I'll be there waiting for them. Waiting to see the stupid looks on their faces when either their pride is dashed or their false pride destroys any shred of possibility of their survival. Waiting for them to show up like ants in line for some table scraps.

Tolkien built his world from what he knew (we can only do that), so noticing real world parallels is just natural. He copypasted patterns he thought would fit. How he applied them was largely influenced by his own bias, even unknowingly. He also cast moral judgement, expressing hate against those characters who dared to make up their own mind, who weren't servile.

In this world,
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?
Is it like the hand of god hovering above?
At least it is true that man has no control
Even over his own will.

Or at least that's the official translation but now I think about it, it's steering the interpretation away from what was intended. It's not that man has no control over it but that man cannot be free with it. More accurate translation of last two lines would be this:
Even when it comes to one's own will
Man cannot do as he pleases/Man is not at liberty

>>4553
I'm not familiar with the context as far as Tolkien's work but what you've written shows a larger misunderstanding. When you put it like that it's counter intuitive but if you reframe it and consider that being led by your ambitions or passions is not freedom then maybe the idea of servility for the right cause won't offend you anymore.

Ah! Heavens! If only we just took the matters in our own hands, moved our fat lazy asses and did SOMETHING!
If only someone rose up to lead us against Stock Boogeyman#1 or #2!
Because it's not like almost or every revolution was orchestrated from the start and that a charismatic, reliable character a crowd mentality resigns it's judgement and thinking faculties to who miraculously appears when he's needed the most has been supplanted beforehand to cause the people to wreak havoc against pawns of no bearing on the end game.

It's not just human beings we're against, those are just tools and as difficult as it's to accept - victims themselves, hopelessly duped. There is a supernatural component to this conspiracy and intelligence beyond our feeble minds that moves it forward century by century from the dawn of civilization.

Maybe there's some hope in 100th monkey phenomenon or that God will come to save the day but from what I read He's only planning to drop by when everything goes irreversibly to hell and then we get a wholesale judgement in fucking fire that'll melt every bloody thing. Because it's better to let things go unchecked and be all wrathful and angry, when super intelligent immortals He wouldn't bother to keep on a leash surprise surprise overpowered mankind, than to put some effort into micromanaging your creation.

Alright, Anon, I watched the video and thought about your post for awhile. While I agree with your take that there is little to be done (or little reason to try at all), I cannot understand your apparent negativity towards God and the virtues of His Creation. I really don't want to type an essay here, but simply understand that Satan is the representation of all things conducive to non-existence, whereas God is the inverse. By virtue of God existing, Satan had to be refuted, and he will be. God, Humanity, and Creation are all not flawed as you seem to believe, but evil must be refuted, as it is forced into being by the existence of good.
As for the video, the lad in it had my full support up and until the end. Just because the opposition as it exists is controlled, does not mean the actual concept of opposition itself is inherently flawed or manipulative.
Otherwise, good info, and maybe look into the ways the Masons and their predecessors have been dealt with (temporarily) in the past.

Evil is not forced into existence by the existence of good. Satan was created good and went bonkers (check out the meanings of Heylel, Strong's 1966, one of those is 'insane') that seems to be the real reason for evil. A sickness that overcame the second most intelligent being, and from what I can gather every evil allowed is allowed in an effort to cure that sickness because 'God wishes none to perish' but it's too much. I can agree with the 'evil needs to be refuted' bit, I can see the need for that but fucking hell. How many kiddos need to be violently raped, terrified into soul fracturing trauma and harvested for rut and high inducing chemicals in their blood? With my petty earthly mind I can imagine locking someone up in a simulation where as many lessons can be administered without the need for creation to suffer for that. As it stands whatever 'virtues of His Creation' pale before the horrors of satanic ritual abuse and that's only things we know, allowed out probably to traumatize us indirectly.
That's a heavy hitter but there are more mundane stuff like everyday injustice, genetic lottery, men and women desiring and expecting different things (that one would be a pretty easy thing to fix), unrequited love and the fact that lust isn't dependent on love (another fucking easy fix, so much evil gone with just that), subjection to the elements and material needs which will be the thing pushing people to whatever satanic system that ultimately we end up with because everyone needs to eat (God doesn't give a shit about fulfilling material needs - not talking about wants here, needs, I guess children in Africa aren't worth more than a multitude of sparrows lol; oh and btw we were supposed to be able to rule over elements, turn water into wine and pirate food - John 14:12 but I guess screw that, no freedom from the curse for you, you're saved but only on paper lol now suffer so you show me you love me because a loving husband and father tortures his wife and children constantly to see their devotion, oh but I didn't lie or give you false hope, no no, you'll get that when you'll have an immortal body so you won't need that shit anyway).

>As for the video, the lad in it had my full support up and until the end. Just because the opposition as it exists is controlled, does not mean the actual concept of opposition itself is inherently flawed or manipulative.
I've skimmed it and couldn't find the bit you're referring to. Not saying he wasn't saying that, I know one other conspiracy theorist on youtube also had that idea presented and I don't know how to feel about it myself but there's a "resist not evil". Regardless that's something I haven't made up my mind about it yet.

>and maybe look into the ways the Masons and their predecessors have been dealt with (temporarily) in the past.
As you yourself have noticed that didn't really change anything. If Mystery Religion were to be defeated the cause for it's success needs to be taken out. One is humanity's hate of people that they feel that don't fit. Many intuitives get inside cults because of alienation and that only deepens when they're initiated into a order that keeps telling them they're superior and above the blind masses (and it'd be very hard to think otherwise after trying to interact with normal people, maybe try to warn them and get laughed at or ignored). Love thy neighbour as thyself is the solution. Not gonna happen because of material worries and all the stuff related to that like status. We're fucked.

>What is seperationism?
Seperationism is the principle
by which one seperates himself
from undesirable circumstances,
usually those related to daily
life. In this case, we are seeking to help each other overcome Masonic garbage.
>B-but OP, I can't stop living!
No shit. You can chsnge how you are living though. Every time you become more self-sufficent, the less the world has power over you.
>An Example?
The easiest would be learning how to homestead. Start a garden that can supplement at least 7 percent of your yearly groceries, or even just start collecting rainwater or compost.
Another prime example is to start saving videos or communications on private systems like your PC or alternative services to limit the ability of Big Tech to manipulate others.
>Won't I look weird?
Yes, most will see you as a hermit that avoids attachments, but if you want to be attached to the average normie, you are on the wrong board. Get closer to family, and choose a few friends to maintain close tues with, and for God's sake, cut the damn social media cord.

You know you can start small, right?
If you have land or a large apartment, start a garden/window garden.
If you can't do that, stockpile useful goods or bullion.
You don't have to have everything, but at least have something to contribute when those who have prepared offer to help you.

I agree with your sentiments, so please take my advice:
"Normie" has been co-opted by reddit. P O S T I N G L I K E T H I S when not doing A E S T H E T I C S was always a normalfag meme. "Kike" is some of the most overused anti-mason slang; use "heeb" or something different, not to mention, actually use it when it's relevant, which it is not in this case.
*Actually, even "normalfag" is becoming used in certain places. Thus, "norman" or even simply "pleb" might be better.

Is it a sin for a Christian to have sex with a succubus? Anonymous 10/24/2019 (Thu) 17:12:41 [Preview] No. 3602 [Reply] [X] [Last 50 Posts]
I'm a Christian but I'm really really lonely and I want to summon a succubus to be my lover, but I'm really afraid of going to hell. I don't anything evil that hurts anybody and I certainly don't want to blaspheme or renounce God. I just want somebody to make love to and cuddle with afterwards as I drift off to sleep with her. I thought about watching succubus hypno videos but I'm scared that I'll accidentally pledge my soul to Satan while I'm under a trance. Does anyone have any advice? Since succubi are fallen angels does that mean they can still be redeemed in God's eyes? Also, in the hypothetical case that I do summon a succubus and I allow her to punish me by kinkily whipping and spanking me, does that qualify as punishment for my sins if I enjoy it?

saw that word again in this occult page. Usually i think these accounts are just goth like. But then you see the all seeing eye and this brings the possibility of professional satanism. Even monetizing it through clothing and masonelry fronts to maybe sell blood and heads. And then using masonic imagery as i am guessing gang like affiliation to protect the satanism. this is part of what i believe is a silent war going on inside of masonry. Not all are even aware of the mess.

I have been thinking about this for years and want to try it. I want to set back my reality to a certain date and time all while keeping my knowledge I have gained. Of what I have seen this possible with the multiple universes theory. What I am mainly looking for is to take my consciousness out of this neurology and place it with into an alt-universe serve. An alt universe self with in a reality that is still in the desired time. The way with in the field of the occult is to astral-project either cross dimensionally and or cross chronology. what do you guys think? got any other ideas or info.

Humanity should be constantly shitting its pants at how unfathomably hostile the universe is to us. Only by uniting to protect ourselves while still respecting our individuality can we hope to survive.

Not only have satellites found a wall of FIRE at the edge of the solar system, but we have detected radio transmissions, however faint, that we did not create.

How do you propose we answer the xeno question, /horror/? Do you think the occult elite is trying to prevent us from maintaining ourselves through expansion?

that doesn't mean that shit isn't about to go down (with the soft disclosure already out and ufo programming ramping up in intensity) but it's not shit from Pleiades, Sirius, Orion or whatever star loaded with significance in witchcraft but either from underground or/and another dimension and it's nothing new, they've been fucking around with us since the very start

Rings and Diamonds Anonymous 07/24/2020 (Fri) 02:14:54 [Preview] No. 4043 [Reply] [X] [Last 50 Posts]
A few sources of esoteric knowledge allege that the practice of wearing rings is a subtle part of saturn/cube/satan worshiping tradition that has been worked into our modern customs since saturn is the only ringed planet in the solar system.
I havent seen any good evidence or much reasoning on this point, yet i find the ubiquity of diamond rings being very peculiar.
Diamonds at their most pure forms are simply repeated cubic structures of carbon, the 6th element on the periodic table, with 6 electrons and being the basis of all life on earth, commonly mined by impoverished africans and being at the core of many african conflicts. Along side this, many women have been conditioned by these diamond selling masonelry companies to go after an extremely expensive diamond ring above all else in a marriage.
The combination of the sixes in the element, the structure, the nature of how they are collected and how they have been pushed into our culture seems very offputting to me
The title of carbon being the 'master element' of all life on Earth, the cubic structures it usually forms and how children are often harmed collecting carbon in the form of diamond gives me very demiurgic/saturnian connotations

does anyone have any more information about carbon/diamonds/rings in the occult sense?
is there a consensus about the origins of rings and diamonds?

Onyx rings used for psychic vampirism. wrist rings used in druidry. Nose rings bull style for some cults. Masonic rings with s and c on the outside and swiveling into a square and company. clankety big rings used in ceremonials. Ritualism, tokens of initiation in some sense. Ring being the hook into the initiate as they are lead by cattle rope etc. Simular to choker loko babes. kind of like pins but for plateaus of initiation if i recall or understand correctly. Crowley used rings to change his mood shift rings to another hand. diamonds pinial glands or the alchemical stone adrenochrome. Big jester symbol is the diamond unsure of its meaning.

diamonds sound close to adamant and both are touted for being the hardest substance
adamant goes to Saturn's sickle and more importantly adamantine prison, place where fallen angel watchers are kept
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds could be worked out as Lucifer in the Sky (i.e. Saturn, the black sun that gives invisible light leading to illumination) with the diamonds either being shining stars (angels) or harkening back to adamant therefore pointing to Saturn as the place of or symbol for adamantine prison (compare to Alice in Chains - Alice=Lucy=Lucifer and chains being the chains of adamant)
there's always more to this stuff but that's the best explanation I've found so far

Bill cooper really is under-rated when it comes to people like art bell and alex jones.He always got back to the point of it all. I heard the other day a show he did in 2000 where he was getting angry that the news was lying about how a plane was missing he said there will be a lot more plane incidents and it was so obvious. He knew about 9/11 and he knew about the school shootings beforehand.

milton made the elite so mad they killed him. Yes he was murdered and alex jones said (and I am paraphrasing here)he was "a drunk lunatic who kept harrasing me after I let him on my show a couple of times" after he was murdered. Alex jones is profiting off of what would have been bill coopers take on the world. They had officers on the roof of his home who hit him with bullets fatally. How could it have been like the mike brown situation when he was being shot at so much a cop on the roof of his house shot him? He had meticulously broadcasted things that I even speculate and do not triple fact check. He was the american man when you hear him talk to listeners it reminds you of the good old days that may have really existed. When he talks about how people are afraid and uninformed and his rage at talking to a sleeping world he richeously coined the term sheeple. He was also apparently part of naval intelligence because he was a demolay and checked freemason in clubs on a military application. Recently Q had dropped hints of bill cooper being part of the great awakening movement within the intelligence community. He had CAjI the Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence. He had people infiltrate lodges and even had a 3 hour interview with a 32nd degree mason who confirms masonic guillotine depopulation plans by freemasons. I feel obligated to go back and listen to him every now and then and what he was was a man in control in a crazy world. This thread is to post good clips and anything Hour of the time related.

I may be wildly off but didn't Bill with his Project redlight tapes along with the lectures/luxor hotel/Deely plaza videos... - Didn't he create the genre of conspiracy documentary? True alternative media long form expose's on specific conspiracies like who killed JFK and area51(he claimed to have introduced the public with the location and lore of area 51).
I can't think of anything aside from the patterson Bigfoot footage walking in the woods of anything before that. By the way he kind of with his basically pirate short wave radio program and his videos and series. I believe he changed the rhetoric of conspiracy completely by initially the ufo nonsense. Ufos and aleins are one of the largest psyops done to the public. He established credibility in that field and single-handedly proved how it is a deception. Did Bill Cooper create the format of conspiracy videos? Well he made it so that cable-TV at the time and the controlled opposition step up from their usual servings of Elvis faking his death, Bigfoot, and of course aliens. Isn't is convenient how Bigfoot and Elvis and extra-terrestrials have absolutely no impact on anything in real life? He changed to tone and beyond that I believe with the masonic expose's it lit up something in the heart of the nation. We then saw the "satanic panic" of the early 90's. Interesting that the "satanic panic" followed after his mystery Babylon series. Almost as if people where throwing themselves at being suicided to go on daytime tv and beg for people to understand that their kids where being taken to rituals and abused by luciferians. The blue house case in Evansville Indiana sparked David Carrico to publish the Egyptian satanic masonic connection.
The "satanic panic" was basically pizzagate but with hundreds of children and distraught families supporting the children who did not know each other claiming all over the world that they where being sra'd .basically they called it fake news with the false memory syndrome and by calling it a hysteria. They stopped it and shut it down when the consensus began to come out that it was freemasons and "secret societies like the oto" and though they where forced to blame their masonic abuse on things set out for them to blame like michael aquino - through tremendous shilling they insisted it was masonic covert satanism and thus it was no longer a satanic panic but the victims where simply having false memories" the fake news'' of the 90's.in the 90's soccer moms where going public supporting their childrens testimony and many families where suicided by "satanists". A lot of people a lot of dirty masonic law enforcement people have blood on their hands since then trying to steward the conspiracy narrative. A lot of "normal" people too like jim and every mason personally would insist in things like how the cult they are in is not alive anymore as a secret society that its historically known as. Lying to your face about that shit and acting like talking about aliens is like riding a ferris wheel. Bigfoot is fun to discredit controlled violence without repercussion. So then when youtube emerged we saw the symbolism videos and the Illuminati. Thats when alex jones comes in and mentions masonry lesser and lesser but implying it (not specifically) with words like "globalists" "banksters" and "deep state". It doesnt end there oh no have you has anyone seen any kind of thread about organized satanism on 8chan in the last year or so? How many fucking times do these freemasons have to insist its the fucking kikes like I am gonna have to respect the kikes as if its like some fucking praise kek nonsense? I have to praise kike and call everyone a kike and only focus on kikes as masons are fucking acting like snowglobe shakers and hidden hand circle jerks?? Because of that specifically because of the moderate in frequency occurences of freemasons blaming jewish people on anything at all I can never respect the kike theory. I am not a retard I do not let kikes in media in anything tell me anything just like I can not afford to do the same with

I was referring to the psyop to convince people (not convince but peer pressure) and coerce people into having to just call them the globalists. To blame aliens and to overtly use red herrings and ignore the masonic part of the judeo power base to convince me of anything. I was not saying "not a chance in hell" to the motto of the board to "Read everything , listen to everyone.believe nothing unless you can prove it." rather to the point of getting lead astray with popularism and viralism into having to think in the kike alt right mindbox. NOT A CHANCE IN HELL. LIBERALS AND FAKE ASS MASON "PATRIOTS" are the SAME thing. Antifa and the kkk ARE BOTH CULTISTS.

Does anyone have obscure information on these groups to share?

I know the Templars were corrupted by their search for knowledge, but what about the others?
Honestly I'm especially curious about the Livonians, did they know anything about the evil forces at play, and if so can we use that to stop Masons and the like now?

Since Templars are said to have started with nine members I'd venture to say they've been corrupt from the very inception - see Ennead and ONA (Order of Nine Angles or Angels rather).
Hospitallers had a beef with Templars but I don't know if that was just a trivial power struggle (or a show) like English vs French masonry or nazis vs commies. Whatever the case Hospitallers - Knigths of Malta are the same occult shit now. Curiously enough Malta is an island with a very intriguing area in terms of megalithic structures and legends of giants.
Not very familiar with Livonian Order but since it fell under Teutonic Order I can only tell you it couldn't have been on the side of good. Teutonic Knights were just a medieval attempt at drang nach osten under the guise of spreading christendom and veiled in deviously crafty diplomacy. Slaughter, rape, pillage didn't matter as long as it was against heathens lol.

It's naive to expect a force of good in the world of darkness that should defeat the darkness by employing the ways of the darkness it seeks to overthrow. Only thing that could've helped would be genuine biblical Christianity since it addresses the core problem but the stage is already set for widespread persecution even in the so called civilized countries so it won't be a solution you perhaps hope for. But a solution is not possible.

World has to fall for people to understand that even at their highest wit they're foolish and, despite utmost efforts, helpless. I'm not talking about the Great Reset here but another attempt at a golden age that comes later with a promise of solving all the ills of this world but will end up a nightmare.

They didn't stop their aggression on Lithuania even after they converted and eventually bit the hand that fed them and which had let them settle where they have in the first place. They were just a political force coming up with nice sounding justifications for conquest.
Western education seems to have a romanticised view of the Teutonic Order for some reason. Maybe it's because they look cool with those horns on their helmets but then again - horns on the helmets.

I can momentarily focus to add extra information to what I see, eyes open like visualize simple math with objects and see through the door if I know what’s behind the door (more like game-like wireframe model). I’ve been able to do this since I’ve been a child so I was wondering if this phenomenon has a name or if I’m just autistic. I don’t have any diagnoses other than depression.

That is called scrying. Also remote viewing. Now one of the most frustrating things about occultism is they do not emphasize that visualization means imagination. These robot fucks are so set on keeping stupid cult shit hidden in plain sight they need to be walked through imagining a pentagram. I have tried to visualize to the point of psychedelic visuals and have never been successful. By psychedelic visuals i mean actually being able to draw as if the world is an alpha layer and the mind can holographically create whatever i imagine. I Used to be able to do it as a child though. I imagined a pink amorphous goo pre-ditto that i called plaadthicka. One day playing with the plaadthicka it morphed into 2 red eyes staring at me. scared that instinct out of me.So they do this to ruin the imagination of children you see

Fascinating. Scrying, aa in the old days, with certain scribes reading bones in a fire to navigate information. It seems the old styles of such have evolved majorly in our psyche over the course of millenia. You say visualization emphasises imagination, and that is truly interesting.

One day, while listening to a video of Bill Donahue (Ewetube channel) speak about imaging within the mind, the realization became quite clear how to look at the word imagination. You have three words, of course more if you wish to break it down more, but for the sake of discussion, I will talk of image-i-nation. Your mind's eye, or i, holds its own nation within. You are able to image directly within it, because the nation is a domain where one may conjure up images. This is partially what Jesus spoke of with bearing false images. Never was it intended to be literal (this is how the esoteric order of priests of religion speak unto the masses, or the exoteric circle). We craft images physically, externally, but not before we conjure images mentally, internally. Beforeit is made manifest through our hands, it is created in the image eye nation. Sounds silly, but with a trained eye is one able to build anything they desire.

Adding onto this, I live in America, the nation here bears symbols everywhere. This is to ensure our eye stays captivated by symbols and not signs, which are commonly given by the Creator. By ensuring that the mass hypnosis led by the de-sign-ers keeps people powerless with their imagination, children grow up leaving behind their abstract mind, and adopting a concrete, or con-create, mind that is grounded by instilled methods of mental application. Smoothing the wrinkles. There are few who manage to fade away from this conditioning that the schools enforce onto the children.

>>3975
Have you encountered moments where you feel out of body with these experiences? Or possibly, when adding extra information, do you sense that you're pulling information from out of nowhere? Curiously so, there is a similar phenomenon that happens when it comes to dialing back memories and uncovering information buried in the details. As though I am hyper-analyzing it photographically.

I believe what OP is referring to in his post is visualization instead of scrying. Visualizing is manipulating your optical brain to see things that may not necessarily exist. I can visualize an apple in my hand, which doesn't exist. Astral projection is the idea that by visualizing you can see through a network (the main one being the tree of consciousness, seeing through another being's eyes). If I imagine an alien landscape that is visualization. If I visualize an alien landscape with the idea that I'm viewing it from a point in an omnipresent entity that I have tapped into through the tree of consciousness that's astral projection. Scrying would be looking into smoke or tea leaves and seeing a pattern in the sediment or smoke and interpreting that pattern. Remote viewing would be looking at a box and visualizing what is inside, with the idea that you can see inside the box, perhaps through the omnipresent being like in astral projection.

ritual abuse in certain geographic locations (usa)? Anonymous 06/02/2020 (Tue) 05:40:01 [Preview] No. 3912 [Reply] [X] [Last 50 Posts]
is there a good onion where i can ask questions to verify things like this? or would posing here be good?

i have some questions about possible networks in two specific states and i really want to know if anyone else knows anything. it's really hard to get answers, though, since this is such a diffcult topic for survivors of cult abuse/mind control/etc. to discuss. nothing i'm thinking about is (or seems to be) masonic or satanic, but it's still ritualized sexual brainwashing and trafficking.

would be happy to take any outbound links to relevant forums or to discuss here if anyone has heard anything.

The thing is, with networks like this, they tend to be entirely conspired and leak free, because the motivation to conspire propagates itself through each new member inherently.

The only way would be to go undercover and partake, then you'll have things you can be black mailed for, and you won't be able to leak anything without basically committing suicide.

When leaks do happen, it's hard for them to be verified through any corroboration. (read above for why.)

how they get new members could be a vector for finding these groups. Be it through digital means or by networking. The same way there is no official black market. big players in crime would know about these things. the elite know about these things. jeffery epstein was a leak in my opinion. rachel chandler was supposedly a procuror involved with satanic activity. now we have a satanic cult. is it clandestine? and sadly that is where the trail ends. because in my opinion its behind the veil of initiation by which these things open up to those tapped into such networks.

What is the esoteric practice, if not the active pursuit of transcendence? And that can be achieved by many means, some of them purely mental, some of them physical. When evaluating this question, it can be said that inventing technology is the final step of the alchemist's path, an act of extention of one's will, manifested on the physical plane. Because as above, so below. That being stated, let's proceed further.


[b]"All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near."[/b]

[b]"Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the director of the opponent's fate."[/b]

- Sun Tzu


As Theodore Kaczynski has observed, modern technology is the biggest rule-changer that dawned on humanity since the beginning of written history. Not only does it radically alter human behavior, it can be used to create a new caste system where those who are at the edge of technological advancement virtually become a seperate species. Now, a lot of us managed to establish that at the core of the elite's esoteric religion lies a doctrine of Prometheus. The doctrine that was roughly described in Isaac Asimov's short story "The Last Question" or in Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey". A doctrine that places man at the throne of all matter, in essence making him God himself. That's what the old Mystery Religion was all about. Fundamentally, it seeks total destruction of the material universe in order to reinvent it, make it anew, make it sentient and full of willful power. It's the most ambitious alchemical operation ever conceived by the human mind. But I digress. That's their long term plan.

The short term plan is to make us slaves, i.e. the lowest tier worshippers in the cargo cult of technology. If you want to enslave someone, first, you have to be superior to them. Superior psychologically most of all, and superior in all other ways if possible. That's where technology comes into play. Did you ever notice how all the major players tend to not die? They all seem to live roughly a hundred years, always being fully aware and alert, looking healthy till the day they croak. Why is that? Is it a special diet they all subscribe to? Clean food and water? Exercise? Yes, quite possibly. But a lot of them engage in extreme drug indulgence, promiscuity and straining ritual conduct (sexual and otherwise), which surely can lead to an accelerated deterioration of the body that should result in an untimely death. A shill by the name of Alan Watt once said that they're equipped with blood puryfying devices strapped to their venous systems at all times. Well, maybe so. William Cooper stated on many occasions that they're 30 to 100 years ahead of the public when it comes to technological advancement. It's only logical, given that they're at war with the public.

it appears to be one but it also can be seen as the 14 and the fish. Q posted that picture leading me further to think it was playing on symbolism on multiple levels. an interesting connection is the black sun on his manifesto the great replacement. he was also seen doing the ok hand gesture in court. Was he an actual lone wolf white sepretist or was he part of some bigger scheme? I think its interesting that it was defiantly something used to try and take down 8chan. Cabal asset basically.

that is if they say its raining outside or are sanding down a plunger that doesn't belong to them. do not cower when they do their intimidation routines or little plays. I suppose they need people to be afraid of the fact they are satanists. Mainly because of the brute physicality of shredding humans apart underneath the water underground by the bridge or whatever they do. in fact it builds hatred. It appears to be a religious thing so demeaning the glory of Lucifer would piss off these order following cultists i would imagine.

Posting images of possible global FEMA-style camp operation occurring around cement plants around the world. Related to the infamous incident in Tucson where they found that supposed 'Rape Camp' on the grounds of a cement plant off the side of the highway just south of the town.

It turns out that hundreds of cement plants around the world are located suspiciously close to golf courses, and some in fact overlap and are literally on each other's property.

Cemex is a re-occuring name in a lot of this stuff. I remember speculation about grinding bones and human remains into the cement. on top of that very masonic in the professional sense.The fact that they are near golf courses makes you wonder if there is stuff going on underground.

>What is happening here

Hundreds of cement plants from the "Big 3" producers (Cemex, LafargeHolcim, Heidelberg Cement (Lehigh Hanson)) appear near major landmarks, golf courses and nature preserves, and are often located close to Elks Lodges, JW Kingdom Halls and in some cases, shriner temples.

>So What

The Big 3 cement makers are closely tied to major elite figures such as the Rothschilds (Cemex), European and Canadian oligarchs (Lafarge/Heidelberg). They operate on shipping channels, and at times are the only user of those channels, sometimes transporting goods by rail or shipping vessel.

>What's the point

After the Cemex debacle in Tucson, it really seemed like many people SHUT IT DOWN really quickly.
Chelsea Clinton called it a "Second Pizzagate" despite hundreds of other Pizzagate-like accusations levied against people between Comet and Cemex.

>Which leads to

Hillary Clinton being a former board member of Lafarge, fmr Cemex CEO on Trilateral commission, and crazy shit like Lafarge giving hush money to ISIS in Syria.

I am looking into options. gab, telegram channel, and it crossed my mind to seek here. I ve come here for reprieve to /horror/ when i needed a change. I think that /horror/ board owner has started a thread on q research and we do some cross postings. if not they are pulling much masonic material from here. what does requesting a dig thread entail in terms of getting ahold of a bo for permission request?

Statistically speaking yes. There are people being born every minute. But the number of examples here and the consistent chart matching and similar facial characteristics. The idea is that certain people are being moved around and put into different places to be used in a grand scheme.

Masonic letterhead digging Anonymous 06/25/2018 (Mon) 21:25:00 [Preview] No. 2031 [Reply] [X] [Last 50 Posts]
The anon who made the huge oathbreaker get on 4chan gave us info about the letterhead breadcrumb from the /x/ screenshots about the masonic insider. He has risked his life to give out that info and was already abused all of his life. We have to figure this out.
He was taken to this (underground?) farm and had his memory partially wiped. This thread is to research and dig to find the letterhead and/or corroborating info about the university's alumni list along with professors and those who work with them

https://archive.is/a23FJ#selection-26661.791-26661.1042
>Do you remember a few years back the famed "Masonic Letterhead" about directions to a kid farm in Illinois? There are a couple old /x/ screenshots regarding this and I'm here to tell you if you or anyone can find it on tor, DO IT; it is 100% accurate.

https://archive.is/a23FJ#selection-27791.0-27772.8
>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Illinois.

https://archive.is/a23FJ#selection-29273.0-29273.250
>To elaborate more on Urbana: The university's alumni list along with professors and those who work with them may yield interesting connections to masonry as well as the appendant bodies and assorted shady shit. Masonic directories are publicly listed


>>1855
>Wanted to clarify that the farm is not necessarily near the University, it is in a forested area somewhere among the endless corn and soybean fields. If you look into professors, alumni and associations, you will be able to construct a map [for lack of better term] that will lead you to it. I hate that my memory is fucked from that time period from using because I would point you right to it.

it has nothing to do with the letterhead in particular (maybe with the farms though) but i am almost positive now the chicken symbolism is a codeword for human farming. Look at this shit.

Hey MN, if you could write the plot line of a game what would it be? What sort of pills would you drop and what elements and characters would you include?

Also, I saw a really interesting video about Neom I thought you might like.

However you in between initiations or level increases you are approached by the truther faction to record a violent ritual and much like the initial goal of fighting both the faction and the cult to record and upload a human sacrifice video.


You also could make a sim city or a civilization kind of game where you use the secret socities to control the masses. The goal of the game is to kill all non initiates and dominate the entire map. The only challenge is to get the people to kill themselves by having crime guilds do false flags and you have to have enough media power to be able to do false flags. There is not tanks or weapons just toggleable policemen to "arrest people". Also wait you can have an adrenechrome part of the game where you farm children and cull people into cages like sim farm.

It was a dan Schneider carechture. Not neccisarily Dan himself. So you could have a high witch be called Mrs. Clifton instead of hillary clinton. The game is contriversial enough you can't include public figures you would have to make people who are modeled after them.

Pic related is so common you might not even notice the eye staring at you. This is a huge blindspot in this whole tech field a symbol of an eye is not something to represent any kind of privacy so what on earth is going on with all of these people using this?
It is too common to even try and make all instances of an eyeball in tech logos its way too common and its a security risk. People need to stop thinking its a symbol of privacy its the symbol of being in league with people that kill people in masonic rituals and the torture of man in general. It appears to have been the eye of reason at some point the ancient idea of god someone always watching you and now its used to say they are gods like a twitter verification.

They dont put this on their webpage because they think they are illuminati they think they really are illuminati and that is what masons tell themselves that they are the illumined ones. May also be a sodomy reference given the brown eye color. These guys are secretly butt-fucking and teaching each other squid server administration and things of that nature and its a very real time in history right now. But sadly a really fake time in our ability to be real about this people want to think its not a problem it is a problem because they work as one cult unit to make sure that they have their own small buisnesses and they kill people and do all kinds of things to mitigate non masons. They are saying that they see you as a victim by putting that eye on there if they intended to do so or not

BO I wont namefag, suffice it to say, my thread on Q board is nuked, and I want to make an effort to produce something. "Illuminated" manuscripts are those which have notes in the margins. Any of us can do it. In this case I just want to upload scans as I proceed through this book. The previous owner will also have his pencil notes followed, to the pages he noted. I find a sort of company with those who owned a book before I did, and yet with whom I would have camaraderie. I certainly invite comment or critique, the thread will proceed like this, I will try to upload three at a time, in proper order, no flood, I will do maybe thre pages every few days. Best to you.

Okay being in a rush, I have already mislabelled my first three scans, with "pitg" (pawns in the game) which is his other book. Proper name convention would be "rfoa" for red fog over america, this book. Apologies. I wanted to get these six pages up, to invite discussion and set the stage for 2020.

I really like the Steins;Gate series, which mostly deals with time travel and conspiracies. John Titor, basically the origin point of internet conspiracies, plays a central role in the story. The atmosphere of the visual novels is really nice, and you can really feel the danger and paranoia of the main characters when shit gets real. As a sci-fi work, it deals with secret technology that governments use to their own ends, kind of like how people think the government has secret Nikola Tesla tech.

News outlets have been a little too eager to claim 33 casualties despite the precise noumber being unknown.
The story sounds suspicious. This isn't such a high building. Jumping out and breaking bones is preferable to burning alive.
If it's going to follow into internet censorship it's pretty much given it's the same shit as with shootings and gun control.

I think it is definatly an inside job/false flag. I don't think japan has to do censorship they just adjust the npc levels in the water and people self censor. Lol jk. But its probably not a vie for censorship as much as it is the elite toying with the public and usign this as human sacrifice in the form of a false flag. Im not sure what anime studio it was i remember this it was around last week. Very strange you see this kind of thing often the 33 trapped chilean miners stuck in a mine. They love that number.

that ancestor is then shown as a projection from saturn styled into a 'dark sun'

I see it clearly but I still don't get why would any occult mastermind or whatever do that
and it's such a fun show too

It could be that it was a deception and not the actual ancestor. Being beamed from saturn to mess with the redhead.

Have you ever wondered that Paul may have been an attempt at destroying christianity from the beginning. It makes sense that the enemy would attempt this. Even the bible has been corrupted.

Then in this case, Paul wouldn't have qualified for "apostleship" in the sense that the other 12 apostles were, but was an "apostle" in again his own certain criteria.
Hence why he was called the "apostle of the gentiles".
>It doesn't say that at all, in fact. It doesn't even mention he was there at all.
<The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well
It does.
>I think have differing interpretations of this entire passage. My way of seeing it is that Paul called the law a curse and that you can be saved just with faith and works are an extra benefit. That is wrong. This is why I brought up James 2:20
And here, I answered it as I did in the Judaiser general. Anti-Law Pauline Christians and pro-Law anti-Pauline Christians (like you) go with the Law as a curse, but in reality it isn't a curse.
Basically, FAITH is what saves you, while works go along with faith. Many Pauline Christians themselves still don't understand this.
>How do we know he is telling the truth. If it is only Pauls statements I believe they are untrustworthy
Since it's a revelation, of course the only men that know about it are Paul and Jesus.
As for Paul's legitimacy, just compare him to the other Christian "teachers" mentioned in Acts (written by Luke) and the early church's historical records. Simon Magus, Nicholas (founder of the Nicolaitans) etc., all were rejected and rebuked yet Paul stayed.

Ok maybe in english but in the original greek it is written differently.
2 Timothy 1:18
"may grant to him the lord to find mercy from the lord in that day, and for as much as in Ephesus he served better. You know it."
https://biblehub.com/interlinear/apostolic/2_timothy/1.htm
That's the link you used correct? either way this is slightly different as it states that onesiphorus was preaching in Ephesus and Paul himself wasn't there. The only person who claimed to be an apostle and preached in ephesus that we know of in scripture is Paul.

Also I know this is sort of unrelated. But have you noticed the similarites of Saul from the old testament and Saul from the new testament.
>Both were against a decendant of David. Jesus and well David himself
>Both were from the tribe of Benjamin
>Both were named Saul.
>Saul was replaced by David as king and Paul tried to be an apostle.
Just a little nod.

Also why did James question Paul about trying to get rid of the mosaic law. Wny would James have the need to question Paul if he never preached against the law
Acts 18-24

Perhaps, but Jesus in Revelation talks of multiple false apostles in Ephesus. Paul is just a single apostle on the other hand.
>Also I know this is sort of unrelated. But have you noticed the similarites of Saul from the old testament and Saul from the new testament.
Why do you think he was named Saul? Because he was from the tribe of Benjamin.
>Also why did James question Paul about trying to get rid of the mosaic law. Wny would James have the need to question Paul if he never preached against the law
James questioned Paul because Paul said that circumcision wasn't necessary for gentiles under the New Covenant. Even Peter came into conflict with Paul about this, and Paul writes about it in Galatians, incident at Antioch. Of course however this doesn't abrogate circumcision as a whole (he circumcised Timothy)
>"Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: 13And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: 14But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ. 15But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. 16Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away."
Again, same thing with Galatians. He isn't saying the Law is abolished, just that Christ atones for the sins/transgressions of the Law that we all inherently have. Not til heaven and earth pass shall one jot pass from the law.
>Well the first thing we see him do is support the stoning of stephan. Not exactly a stunning representation of christian morale. However that was before his conversion and we saw earlier that James questioned Paul. 
Also the apostles questioned Paul when he first came to them. But it isn't the same as Simon Magus (a Samaritan convert who taught sorcery and wealth) or Nicholas (whose followers, the Nicolaitans are hated by Jesus himself as said in Revelation). Not much questioning going on with Paul, and he was accepted.
>also I see you don't do that Yeshua/Yahshua thing. I think that is stupid myself tbh
It's common among Hebrew Roots movements, but I don't just to keep to standards, since Jesus's name was always transliterated in foreign languages. He even spoke Latin to Pontius Pilate.
It isn't wrong though that the root word for Jesus is technically Joshua. I've heard a man, a Gnostic claim that Jesus is actually the Greek word for healer, or related to Jason. This is nonsensical since "Jesus" in the Septuagint is actually used to refer to Joshua the man who conquered Canaan.

This doesn't mean that Paul isn't being talked about in revelation. That is like me doing this their are multiple false doctrines in christendom. Catholicism is just a single doctrine on the other hand. That doesn't suddenly make Catholicism not a false doctrine that's ridiculous.
>Why do you think he was named saul?
I'm pretty sure the tribe of Benjamin had more names than "Saul"

>Again same things with galatians
How do you explain "for unto this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done awau in Christ. That is literally smacking your head with a bible saying that moses laws were abolished when Jesus said contrary. You're doing mental gymnastics.

Even Peter came into conflict with Paul about this, and Paul writes about it in Galatians, incident at Antioch.

Actually funny thing with this. In acts 15 that was talking about circumcision. Peter and James were actually for restricting circumcision. They also say you are saved by grace in christ. However Paul states the opposite numerous times. This led to James confronting him about it in acts 21. Not to mention in acts 15 the attitude towards Paul was different. They were actually rather positive with him. It's only after he begins his ministry that they begin to question him.

Jesus actually mean's God's salvation. Joshua means God is my salvation.

Perhaps, but you can't say for certain it's talking about Paul, since it actually refers to multiple such false apostles. Perhaps Paul was the exception.
>I'm pretty sure the tribe of Benjamin had more names than "Saul"
Of course, but Benjaminites would've prided Saul as a name as it was used for a king of their tribe.
>for unto this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done awau in Christ
Again, the Law is a way God instructed us to live. To avoid sin. Jesus's atonement pays for our sins. This is what Paul is talking about, not that the Law of Moses was abolished.
>mental gymnastics
Justifying the consistency of Romans 7:12 isn't mental gymnastics.
>Actually funny thing with this. In acts 15 that was talking about circumcision. Peter and James were actually for restricting circumcision. They also say you are saved by grace in christ. 
Acts 15 was most likely after the Incident at Antioch (otherwise the timeline would be very inconsistent), which is where Paul called out Peter regarding circumcision.
>However Paul states the opposite numerous times. This led to James confronting him about it in acts 21. 
Perhaps, however with the Incident at Antioch and the later Epistles Paul's view on circumcision was consistent with Peter's in Acts 15.
>Jesus actually mean's God's salvation. Joshua means God is my salvation.
True, but both are translated the same in Greek. Hence they have to differentiate between Joshua and Jesus, and this carried on to the Vulgate (partially translated from Hebrew), and then to the KJV.

I'm posting this so you guys won't create conspiracy theories. I know, my hope us futile.
If everything goes well soon the site's and our problems will be resolved. But they will turn the site read-only mode for a while. I have no information how long the process will take. Keep calm and be patient.

Thanks.

Odili was erased, confirmed. These posts are fake. This site is now run by the Masons! The 'migration ' was on to Mason servers. I searched the front page and found every letter to spell 'mason', hidden in plain sight. X-files theme tune.
